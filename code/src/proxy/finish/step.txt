Requirements
  - Our customer hire us to implement a Digital Billboard.
  - It should rotating display contents.
  - It will download the contents from the server.
  - However, the server-side system is not yet ready, but our management doesn't want to delay progress.
  - At the current stage of development, the team has already implemented the Billboard and contentStore, which currently always return three pieces of content.

While we're waiting...
  - We need to implement content caching in the contentStore to avoid downloading the contents from the server every time.. 

Steps
1. Create new proxy class, named "ProxyContentStore".
2. The ProxyContentStore constructor should accept ContentStore.
3. Implement caching inside ProxyContentStore.
