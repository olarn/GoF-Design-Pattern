1. Create interface class "GashaponState" :- insertCoin, ejectCoins, and spin.
2. Create Concrete classes for readyState, hasCoinState, readyToSpin, outOfCapsuleState that comform interface class.
3. Create key/values in Gashapon class to store states (avoid circular reference).

    private state: GashaponMachineState = GashaponMachineState.outOfCapsule;
    private states: GashaponDictionary = {
        [GashaponMachineState.ready]: new readyState(this),
        [GashaponMachineState.hasCoin]: new hasCoinState(this),
        [GashaponMachineState.readyToSpin]: new readyToSpinState(this),
        [GashaponMachineState.outOfCapsule]: new outOfCapsuleState(),
    };

4. Now. Start to implement methods for Concrete class.
    4.1 implement one-by-one concrete method based-on existing Gashapon code.
    4.2 Refactor Gashapon code when state needs to call Gashapon methods.
    4.3 Repeat until done all concrete state classes.

Add new feature -> 50% issue 2 capsules.

1. Change spin() return value to be an array.
2. Make fail test to pass.
3. Write test fo WinnerChanceToSpin class to expect 50% return 2 capsule.
4. Add enum winnerChanceToSpin into GashaponMachineState.
5. Write code to pass.

Add 10% chance to get winnerChanceToSpin
